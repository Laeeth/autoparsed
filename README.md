# Autoparsed

Autoparsed is a library to automatically generate parsers.

Users define the grammar by writing classes for the various AST nodes and annotating their constructors.

See the [example](example/) folder for an example that makes use of it.  

You can run the example code with `dub run autoparsed:autoparsedExample` which will parse a single s-expression.
